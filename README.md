# Architectury Loom 1.16.5 Template
Based on: *https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom*

## Setup
Simply set this project wherever you like, and import build.gradle into IntelliJ and let it do the rest!
If you get an error about the java version, make sure to set your project/gradle to use **Java 16**

If you run into an error similar to this:

Then you simply need to change the version of Java being used by Gradle to **Java 16**:
(File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Gradle)

You can either download the JDK through IntelliJ or I'd recommend downloading your java versions through AdoptOpenJDK/Adoptium - https://adoptium.net/
